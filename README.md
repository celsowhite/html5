HTML5 STARTER
===

This repository is based on HTML5 Boilerplate. It's a front-end template I've been customizing for a bit on static site projects.

It uses gulp to autoprefix css, minify css and javascript, convert scss and optimize images. Load all images into the nonoptimizedimg folder and when ready to optimize run 'gulp imageoptimize'. Use the default 'gulp' command to watch scss and js files.

Some handy jquery plugins are packaged in. Including fitVids, smoothScroll, Vimeo API and modernizr.

The grid is a custom barebones grid that uses flexbox. Feel free to customize or add a framework.

This also has cache-control headers set for static files via .htaccess.

Installation
===

- Clone or download this repo.
- Run npm install
- Run 'gulp' to start watching files.
- When you add new images then run 'gulp imageoptimize'
